# Pretty URL Shortener
## [Try it out](http://prettyurls.neocities.org)

Back in the mid-2000s, website developers realized URLs like this looked terrible:

`http://example.com/index.php?mod=profiles&id=193`

So they made "pretty URLs" that looked more like this:

`http://example.com/profiles/193`

It's been a decade since then and URLs haven't gotten any prettier. Until now:

`http://ec2-54-145-181-144.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8000/🌠🌻🌏🌹`

[Pretty URL Shortener](http://prettyurls.neocities.org) will give you emoji URLs using all the prettiest, hand-chosen emoji.
